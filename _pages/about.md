Hi, Welcome! My name is Irfan Dwiki Bhaswara. I am currently working at Jakarta Smart City as data scientist. Here, I focus on developing image processing to capture public complaints through Jakarta Smart City application, called JAKI.

Previously, I got my master degree with a specialization in computer vision and biometrics at the University of Twente under supervision of [Prof. Raymond Veldhuis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raymond-veldhuis-a095019/?originalSubdomain=nl) and [Dr. Dan Zeng](https://www.danzeng.org/about/). I also received my bachelor degree at Gadjah Mada University where my supervisors were [Dr. Igi Ardiyanto](https://acadstaff.ugm.ac.id/IGA) and [Dr. Teguh Bharata Adji](https://acadstaff.ugm.ac.id/tba).

My research interests are computer vision, continual learning, self-supervised learning, few/zero-shot learning, knowledge distillation, and generative adversarial networks. Feel free to contact me anytime!
