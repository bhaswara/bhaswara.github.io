  abstract={This paper describes a class of problem where a detection and localization of car are addressed simultaneously using in-vehicle camera. While the current state-of-the-art researches have tackled the detection problems, in fact, there several rooms for the improvement. One of them is to optimize the detection processes. In this research, we introduce the use of activation map obtained from the last layer of the convolutional network to localize the saliency region of the car and to perform detection of the car objects by collaborating deep architecture trained weight. Our study also finds the benefit of changing the last layer of the network, from fully-connected layer to Global Average Pooling (GAP), which alleviates the overfitting problem. Experiment results on various optimization methods show the impact of the performance, where the proposed GAP-based deep learning and ADAM optimization gives the best results, up to 99.83%. It imply the possibilities of utilizing our method for real case usage scenario.},

  abstract={Face recognition has been a challenging research problem due to many variations, for example occlusions, illuminations, poses, and expressions. In this paper, we review one of the unsupervised learning methods called autoencoder to be used as feature extractor for face recognition system. We explore several types of autoencoder, including regular and generative model, and take quantitative measurements on reconstruction and recognition of face images. Experimental results on Face Recognition Grand Challenge dataset show that there is a potential ability in using autoencoder as feature extractor for face recognition. Furthermore, apart from the latent variable dimensions, the encoder and decoder network of the autoencoder have an important role in the reconstruction and recognition performance. We also found that generative autoencoder model gives better clustering against identity of a subject. In addition, we apply residual network in the generative autoencoder model. We called this Resnet-WAE. It performs better in reconstruction and recognition and achieves area under the curve score of 0.8763 using likelihood ratio classifier. In the end, Resnet-WAE demonstrates promising results of using generative model as feature extractor in face recognition system.},
