  abstract={This paper describes a class of problem where a detection and localization of car are addressed simultaneously using in-vehicle camera. While the current state-of-the-art researches have tackled the detection problems, in fact, there several rooms for the improvement. One of them is to optimize the detection processes. In this research, we introduce the use of activation map obtained from the last layer of the convolutional network to localize the saliency region of the car and to perform detection of the car objects by collaborating deep architecture trained weight. Our study also finds the benefit of changing the last layer of the network, from fully-connected layer to Global Average Pooling (GAP), which alleviates the overfitting problem. Experiment results on various optimization methods show the impact of the performance, where the proposed GAP-based deep learning and ADAM optimization gives the best results, up to 99.83%. It imply the possibilities of utilizing our method for real case usage scenario.},

  abstract = {Automatic detection of facial occlusion is one of the most challenging problems in a face recognition system. Once detected, a face recognition system can process the occluded faces differently to increase the accuracy of face recognition system. In this research, we are interested in detecting occlusion types as well as location for facial occlusion. We treat facial occlusion detection as a special case of object detection and propose a solution that is based on deep neural network architecture and is inspired from Tiny YOLO. We generate a dataset of synthetically occluded faces from occlusion free images of VGGFace2 for training. We explore the impact of different architectures with several adjustments based on Tiny YOLO and provide quantitative evaluations on 90 real occluded face images using log-average miss rate. Our method achieves a performance that is almost on par with Tiny YOLOv2 and is superior to VGG16-backbone model.},

  abstract={Face recognition has been a challenging research problem due to many variations, for example occlusions, illuminations, poses, and expressions. In this paper, we review one of the unsupervised learning methods called autoencoder to be used as feature extractor for face recognition system. We explore several types of autoencoder, including regular and generative model, and take quantitative measurements on reconstruction and recognition of face images. Experimental results on Face Recognition Grand Challenge dataset show that there is a potential ability in using autoencoder as feature extractor for face recognition. Furthermore, apart from the latent variable dimensions, the encoder and decoder network of the autoencoder have an important role in the reconstruction and recognition performance. We also found that generative autoencoder model gives better clustering against identity of a subject. In addition, we apply residual network in the generative autoencoder model. We called this Resnet-WAE. It performs better in reconstruction and recognition and achieves area under the curve score of 0.8763 using likelihood ratio classifier. In the end, Resnet-WAE demonstrates promising results of using generative model as feature extractor in face recognition system.},

  abstract={Jakarta, as the capital city of Indonesia, has facing the same problems every year regarding the issues of floods and garbage. Many innovative solutions have been made until now. One of the solutions is creating JAKI as the Jakarta Super-App platform, which can support public complaints based on geotagging photo. However, it still has lacked that the pictures uploaded by the user are incorrect with the categories. This paper attempts to solve by creating a model that automatically classifies the categories based on the image, especially for flood and garbage image.We propose an approach that uses a deep learning model called SlimCNN. We perform some enhancements on the SlimCNN model called Enhanced SlimCNN. In addition, we visualise our model with class activation maps. The result shows that our enhancement model achieves an accuracy of 96.7% on the JAKI database image. The findings of this study perform better results than the regular SlimCNN and other models, such as Alexnet and Squeezenet. Thus, Enhanced SlimCNN demonstrates promising results as a model solution for the development of Jakarta Super-App.},
